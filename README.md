Analysis of YouTube data sentiment
Data from You Tube is subjected to sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction. To understand the polarities and subjectivities in the sentences, various types of analysis are conducted.



Polarity\sSubjectivity
Polarity: Polarity reveals the sentiment that underlies the sentence. For instance, "I like this course" seems to be a positive statement, so it will have the most polarity. 

Polarity's value ranges from +1 to -1. The polarity will be +1 or negative if the sentence seems to be a very positive statement.

Subjectivity: A sentence is considered subjective if it expresses no sentiment at all. For instance: I attend school. This sentence has a subjective but no feelings.

Various sentiment analysis software packages are available:

TextBlob
